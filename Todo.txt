x  see if same values for different parameters can cause confusions. NO

x  averted cases proportional 

x  parameters others than P1,P2,I1,I2 into titles

   insert switch to either show base experiment or not

1  add bottom 5% and top 5% to timeplot
ok if after TAG

2  make it possible for the boxplot, too, to set the y-axis min max or align over all plots
Do

3  put data load and modifications into a function
only if there is really time and if I anyway have to work on the code again

4s  show somewhere information what base experiment is (if compare==1)
not important

5s  show somewhere on the boxplot over how many years it goes
not important

6s  make the start date (currently 1905) general
not important

x  include a parameter for label rotation

x include a parameter for font size

8! add compare and proportional to timeplot or at least make remark that if
   this is in boxplot, the ylabbel from there will be wrong in the timeplot.

9? change data loading so that data from different simulations can be used?
not needed, as it is probably easier to merge two output folders (after
changing the output nr) and to edit the scenarios.csv file

0  add remote to directory
?

x boxplot also with jpeg-subplot switch

12?clear variables that are no longer needed?
not important

x   make it possible to show no titles

11 improve data structure of Para, etc. (1x6 to 78x6)
not important

NOTE: Be aware that, if there are intervention parameters only applying if
one specific intervention is in use, then there are actually more
experiments in the output than expected, since all parameter choices for 
this ("underlying") intervention parameter are also mixed with the experiments 
without the specific intervention in use. But those extra experiments 
should not be considered since they are exactly the same as other, with 
the same random seeds.
