2   insert switch to either show base experiment or not

make the workflow save the txt file under filename.txt

1  add bottom 5% and top 5% to timeplot
ok if after TAG

3  put data load and modifications into a function
only if there is really time and if I anyway have to work on the code again

(4)s  show somewhere information what base experiment is (if compare==1)
not important

(5)s  show somewhere on the boxplot over how many years it goes
not important

(6)s  make the start date (currently 1905) general


8! add compare and proportional to timeplot or at least make remark that if
   this is in boxplot, the ylabbel from there will be wrong in the timeplot.


(12) clear variables that are no longer needed?

(11) improve data structure of Para, etc. (1x6 to 78x6)








x change data loading so that data from different simulations can be used?
not needed, as it is probably easier to merge two output folders (after
changing the output nr) and to edit the scenarios.csv file

x  see if same values for different parameters can cause confusions. NO

x  averted cases proportional 

x  parameters others than P1,P2,I1,I2 into titles

x  make it possible for the boxplot, too, to set the y-axis min max or align over all plots

x  include a parameter for label rotation

x include a parameter for font size

x boxplot also with jpeg-subplot switch

x   make it possible to show no titles



NOTE: Be aware that, if there are intervention parameters only applying if
one specific intervention is in use, then there are actually more
experiments in the output than expected, since all parameter choices for 
this ("underlying") intervention parameter are also mixed with the experiments 
without the specific intervention in use. But those extra experiments 
should not be considered since they are exactly the same as other, with 
the same random seeds.
