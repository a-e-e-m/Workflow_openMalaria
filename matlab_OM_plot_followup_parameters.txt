%This file is for follow up analysis of the boxplot 
%and specifies for which experiments the dynamics over time should be plotted

%Please insert at what survey time step you want to start the analysis 
start=1140
%note month 1140 is year 2000

%Please insert at what survey time step you want to end the analysis 
%Insert 0 if you want to analysis all the timesteps after start until the end
finito=0

%If you want to correct the values of one survey timestep each year then 
%enter the correction for each timestep in the form 
%SurveyTimestepCorrection=whichtimestep=correctionfactor
SurveyTimestepCorrection=12=0.8571

%Please insert for which experiments the dynamics over time should be plotted
%Use the following format 
%timeplot=n,p,colnr
%where No is just an ongoing number starting from 1, 
%n is the number of the row of the experiment in the subplot,
%p is the number of the column of the experiment in the subplot,
%and colnr is the number of the box of the experiment in the boxplot.
timeplot=2,1,1
timeplot=2,1,4
timeplot=2,1,5
timeplot=2,1,8

timeplot=2,3,1
timeplot=2,3,4
timeplot=2,3,5
timeplot=2,3,8


%Please insert plotmode=subplot if you want to plot the experiments into one subplot
%and plotmode=jpeg if you want to plot the experiments into seperate jpeg files 
plotmode=subplot

%Please insert the number of the age group you want to look at 
%in the form age=number
%insert Age=0 if you want to sum over all age groups considered by the 
%given measure (id)
age=0

%If you want to set the scaling of the y-axis manually, insert
%"yaxmanual=1", else insert "yaxmanual=0".
yaxmanual=0

%If yaxmanual=1, insert here the minimal and maximal value of the y-axis
%in the form "yaxmin=yourvalue" and "yaxmax=yourvalue" on two separate lines.
yaxmin=0
yaxmax=0.18

%If you want to set the labe of the y-Axis manually, enter the label here 
%in the form "yaxis=your_label", else enter yaxis=0.
%yaxis=uncomp cases per person per month
yaxis=0

%If you want to scale the values manually, insert here the scaling factor 
%in the form "scaling=your_value", else enter "scaling=1".
%note: scale by 6.369427 for age group 1 (under five)
%note: scale by 1.18624 for age group 2 (over five)
scaling=6.369427


%in case of plotmode=subplot, Please insert name and path of the pdf 
%in the format path/filename.pdf
